# Structure Django Project
# Enterprise Application

## EnterpriseApplication
- `__init__.py`
- `asgi.py`
- `settings.py`
- `urls.py`
- `wsgi.py`

## best_practices
- migrations
  - `__init__.py`
- `__init__.py`
- `admin.py`
- `apps.py`
- `models.py`
- `tests.py`
- `views.py`
#
### EnterpriseApplication Folder (Project-level):
This is the root folder of your Django project. containing configuration files that are essential to running and configuring the project.
- `__init__.py` : 
- It is an empty file that tells python to treat this folder as a package.
#
- `asgi.py` : 
- ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is the standard interface between web servers and Python web applications.
- It handles the communication between the web server and Python web application, It handles HTTP requests. 
- It is asynchronous. It handles multiple request at a time simultaniously. 
- You use asgi.py when you need asynchronous features like WebSockets or when you need your application to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking.
- Example: Chat applications, live updates of cricket/football scores.
#
- `settings.py`:
- This is the main configuration file for your Django project.
- It includes settings like database configuration, installed apps, middleware, static files settings, template settings, and many other critical Django settings.
#
- `urls.py`:
- This file contains URL patterns for routing HTTP requests to the appropriate view functions or classes.
- Paths of the views are defined here.
#
- `WSGI.py`:
- WSGI (web server gateway interface) acts as an interface between web server and the python web application.
- It handles the communication between the web server and Python web application, It handles HTTP requests. 
- It is Synchronous. It handles one request at a time. The request is processed and the response is returned before handling the next request.
- You use wsgi.py when your application is synchronous, meaning it only handles one request at a time.
- Example: Normal web apps where each request is independent

#
### best_practices Folder (App-level)
This folder contains a Django app. Each app in Django is a module that focuses on a specific functionality.
## migrations/:
- This folder contains database migration files that Django uses to update your database schema based on changes made to your models.
- Migration files are auto-generated when you run python manage.py makemigrations.
- `__init__.py (inside migrations):`
- This file makes the migrations folder a Python package. It is usually empty.
#
- `admin.py:`
- models are registered here, so they appear in the Django admin dashboard for easy CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
#
- `app.py`
- apps.py file is used to configure and initialize an individual app within a project.
#
- `models.py`:
- This is where you define the models for the database.
- Models represent the tables in the database.
#
- `views.py`:
- This is where you write the business logics that handles the requests and returns the response
-  A view is a Python function or class that takes a web request and returns a web response.

# Naming convention best practices.
## Project and App Naming Convention:

- `Project Names:` 
- Should be short and descriptive. Avoid the usage of reserved python key words like django, models and etc.
- eg: myapi, myblog and etc.
- `App Nmaes:` 
- Should be short and descriptive. Avoid the usage of reserved python key words like django, models and etc.
- eg: accounts, orders, payments and etc.
## models Naming Convention:
- `Class Names:` 
- Use CamelCase for class names (capitalizing the first letter of each word). This is the standard for Python classes.
- eg: FlightData, CustomerProfile'
- `Field Names:` 
- use snake_case for field names (lowercase and underscores).
- eg: first_name, date_of_birth, flight_number.
## View Naming Convention:
- `Function-Based Views names:`
- Use snake_case FBVs names.
- eg: post_list, create_order, update_profile.
- `Class-Based views names:`
-  Use CamelCase for class names.
- eg: PostListView, OrderDetailView, ProfileUpdateView.
## Template Naming Convention:
-  Use snake_case for template names.
- eg: post_list.html, post_detail.html, order_summary.html.
##  Static Files and Media Naming Convention:
- `Static File names:`
- Use snake_case for static files.
- eg: main_styles.css, header_image.jpg, app.js.
- `Media File names:`
- For user-uploaded media, it's important to name files in a consistent and predictable way.
## URL Naming Convention: 
- URL Patterns: Use snake_case for URL pattern names and keep them descriptive of the resource.
- eg: post_list, post_detail, order_create.

## Form Naming Convention:
- `Form Names:` 
- Use CamelCase for form class names.
- eg: PostForm, LoginForm
- `Form Fields:` 
- Use snake_case for field names in forms.
- eg: first_name, email, password.
